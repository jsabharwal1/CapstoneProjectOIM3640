**The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.**
<br>
## The main idea of my project is to create an algorithmic trading bot that can autonomously trade on stock exchanges. The project aims to explore topics like financial data analysis, algorithmic trading strategies, and backtesting. The minimum viable product (MVP) for this project could be a basic bot that can access stock market data, analyze it, and make trading decisions based on a pre-defined set of rules. The stretch goal is to implement a trading model that can use historical data and change its trading strategies based on historical data.

**Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.**
## The learning objectives are developing proficiency in Python programming, data analysis, and algorithmic trading strategies. Specifically, my learning objectives are to specific areas of the project, such as developing basic expertise in machine learning or financial data analysis. I also want to learn how to 
**Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.**
## For this project, I will use libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization. Additionally, for real-time stock information, I will be using the Alpaca API. To backtest my code, I will use the backtesting framework - Backtrader to test the trading strategies using historical data. 
**Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.**
## Week 1-2: Research and exploration of libraries and frameworks, data collection, and data analysis.
Week 3-4: Developing the MVP algorithmic trading bot, testing, and refining the strategy.
Week 5-6: In the final weeks of the project I will continue refining the trading strategy, and try my best to include extra-features for the bot, such as making predictions on stock movement. 

**Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?**
## One of the most significant risks in the project is the reliability of the financial data from the API that I use. Since most free finance APIs do not provide reliable information, this will be challenging to work with. Additionally, since I want to use this project to trade with real money eventually, backtesting my strategies will be key or else I could potentially lose money. 

**Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?**
## I think that learning how to use APIs that deal with real-time data would be something interesting that I could learn prior to starting this project since I plan to use real-time APIs that provide stock information.
